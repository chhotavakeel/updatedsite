if you think about it, the alcohol manufacturing business is really the getting-alcohol-into-bloodstreams business with more paperwork and logistics. moving down the value chain can reduce these constraints, and so, if you're a brewing company, you should probably run a chain of pubs on the side. the pubs provide you with a captive market for your brews as well as a diversified income stream.

in fact, you don't even need to start your own chain for this - you can just buy one off the market. or can you? things like pub chains exist at the lowest end of the liquidity spectrum, which is probably why you can't walk into a bar and buy it outright.

the delhi high court kind of agrees? last month, it issued an [injunction](https://delhihighcourt.nic.in/app/showlogo/1761044929_ca132dea8300eafe_jis_4432025.pdf/2025) preventing a craft brewery's investors from selling the shares of a pub chain pledged to them. 

in theory, obtaining an injunction - an emergency order preventing a party from enforcing its rights - requires showing that:<br>
(i) the other party _likely_ lacks the right to proceed against you[^1]; <br>
(ii) you'll suffer more if the right is exercised than your counterparty will if it's not; and<br>
(iii) irreparable harm will be caused to you if the injunction isn't granted.

honestly, i find these criteria a little strange. determining whether one party has the right to proceed against another is sort of the entire point of legal proceedings. and the second and third criteria seem like tautologies? 

in practice, getting an injunction mainly requires you to establish irreparable harm. here, a useful rule of thumb is that if any loss can be quantified, then it's not irreparable because you can be compensated for it in monetary terms. conversely, if you can't ascribe a dollar amount to a loss, then it's likely irreparable! and so, as the brewery's lawyer, telling the court that enforcing the pledge will force your client to part with an irreplaceable and highly illiquid asset is a good move! they should hang this argument in the louvre, now that there's space.

[^1]: usually, you argue that its actions are premature.
