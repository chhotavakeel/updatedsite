if you think about it, the alcohol manufacturing business is really the getting-alcohol-into-bloodstreams business with added paperwork and logistics. moving down the value chain can reduce these constraints, and so, if you're a brewing company, you should probably run a chain of pubs on the side. the pubs provide you with a captive market for your brews as well as a diversified income stream.

in fact, you don't even need to start your own chain for this - you can just buy one off the market. or can you? things like pub chains exist at the lowest end of the liquidity spectrum, which is probably why you can't walk into a bar and buy it outright.

the delhi high court sort of agrees with me? it issued an [injunction](https://delhihighcourt.nic.in/app/showlogo/1761044929_ca132dea8300eafe_jis_4432025.pdf/2025) last month preventing a craft brewery's investors from selling the shares of a pub chain pledged to them. 

now, obtaining an injunction - an emergency order preventing a party from enforcing its rights against you - requires showing that: <br>
(i) the other party _likely_ lacks the legal basis to proceed against you[^1]; <br>
(ii) you'll suffer more if the right is exercised than your counterparty will when it's not; and <br>
(iii) irreparable harm will occur to you if an injunction isn't granted.

i find these criteria a little strange. determining whether a party has or doesn't have the right to proceed against another is sort of the point of court proceedings. and the second and the third seem like tautologies? 

in practice, getting an injunction mainly requires you to establish irreparable injury. a useful rule of thumb is that if a loss can be quantified, it's likely not irreparable because you can be compensated for it in monetary terms. conversely, if you can't ascribe a dollar amount to a loss with a reasonable degree of certainty, then it's likely irreparable!

and so, if you're the brewery's lawyer, you should tell the court that enforcing the pledge will force your client to part with an irreplaceable and highly illiquid asset! this is a great argument to make! they should hang it in the louvre, now that there's space.

[^1]: or more typically, that its actions are premature.
