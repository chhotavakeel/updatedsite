if you think about it, the alcohol manufacturing business is really the getting-alcohol-into-bloodstreams business with added paperwork and logistics. moving down the value chain reduces these constraints, and so, if you're a brewing company, you should probably run a chain of pubs on the side. the pubs give you a captive market for your brews as well as a diversified income stream.

in fact, you don't even need to start your own chain for this - you can just buy one off the market. or can you? things like pub chains exist at the lowest end of the liquidity spectrum, which is probably why you can't walk into a bar and buy it outright.

the delhi high court sort of agrees? it issued an [interim injunction](https://delhihighcourt.nic.in/app/showlogo/1761044929_ca132dea8300eafe_jis_4432025.pdf/2025) last month stopping a craft brewery's investors from selling the shares of a pub chain pledged to them by the brewery. 

obtaining an interim injunction - an emergency order preventing a party from enforcing its rights against you - requires showing that: <br>
(i) the other party _likely_ lacks the legal basis to proceed against you[^1]; <br>
(ii) you'll suffer more if a right is exercised than your counterparty will if it's not; and <br>
(iii) irreparable harm will occur to you if the injunction is not granted.

the first two criteria seem redundant to me. whether a party is entitled to proceed against another is always going to require adjudication - that's why the parties have ended up in court! and the balance of convenience will always lie with the party that's approaching the court for protection, because the other party's doing something to it!

and so, getting an injunction really depends on how you show irreparable injury. if you're the brewery's lawyer, telling the court that forcing your client to part with an irreplaceable and highly illiquid asset - one that's responsible for 35% of their top line - will lead to even more payment defaults on their part is a great argument to make! they should hang it in the louvre, now that there's space.

[^1]: or more typically, that its actions are premature.
