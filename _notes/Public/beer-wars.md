if you think about it, the alcohol manufacturing business is really the getting-alcohol-into-bloodstreams business with more logistics and paperwork. moving down the value chain eliminates these constraints, and so, if you're a brewing company, you should probably run a chain of pubs on the side. the pubs give you a captive market for your brews as well as a diversified income stream.

in fact, you don't even need to start your own chain of pubs for this - you can just buy one off the market. or can you? things like pub chains exist at the lowest end of the liquidity spectrum, which is probably why you can't walk into a bar and buy it outright.

the delhi high court sort of [agrees](https://delhihighcourt.nic.in/app/showlogo/1761044929_ca132dea8300eafe_jis_4432025.pdf/2025)? it recently stopped a craft brewery's investors from creating any third-party interests in the shares of a pub chain that were pledged to them. 

now interim injunctions - court orders preventing parties from enforcing their interests against you - usually require: <br>
(i) establishing a *prima facie* case, i.e., that there's some legal basis to say that the other party lacks a right to proceed against you; <br>
(ii) the balance of convenience lying in your favour - effectively that you'll suffer more if the right is exercised than your counterparty will if it's not; and <br>
(iii) the threat of irreparable harm to you if the injunction isn't granted.

the first two criteria have always seemed redundant. there's obviously a legal dispute between the parties - that's why they're in court! the balance of convenience also always lies with the party approaching the court - the other party's the one that's changing their relationship! if they've done without something for so long, what difference is another couple of years going to make? at least that's how i see it.

and so, interim injunctions really depend on whether you can show irreparable injury. if you're a plaintiff's lawyer, you want to be able to say that forcing your client to part with an irreplaceable and highly illiquid asset that's responsible for 35% of their top line will lead to even more defaults down the road! this is a very good argument! they should hang it in the louvre, now that there's space.
